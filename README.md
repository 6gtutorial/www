WHERE COULD THE 6G TECHNOLOGY BE USED?

I mean, of course, as previously mentioned, it is early to talk about the real-life applications of the 6G technology. But, since this is Telecom, we can make some fair assumptions.

One thing is thus for certain - 6G will reach transfer speeds never imagined before by the human mind. We could be talking 50 times faster than our current 5G - up to 1,000 Gbits/sec!!!


Going even further, we could assume that the 6G technology would enable the sending of human intelligence over the air almost instantaneously. In other words, via 6G, human computation will be able to be sent wirelessly extremely, but extremely fast. Needless to say, it will play an essential part in the wide-scale adoption of artificial intelligence applications like remotely-control robots and other human-like machines.


HOW SOON WILL WE 'GET OUR HANDS' ON THE 6G TECHNOLOGY?

Well, the big players in the Telecom industry are predicting that the 6G technology rollout will take place in 10 to 15 years from now. By then, we will have gotten 'bored' of the 'low' speed provided by 5G and we'll be looking to get higher rates in terms of that.
